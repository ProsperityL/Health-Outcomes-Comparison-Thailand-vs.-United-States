# Health-Outcomes-Comparison-Thailand-vs.-United-States

While the United States dedicates a significant portion of its GDP to healthcare, it lags behind other nations in health outcomes. In 2021, the U.S. allocated 18.3% of its GDP to healthcare, which roughly translate to $12,914 per person. Despite this substantial investment, systemic issues such as high treatment costs, limited access to care, and delays in intervention continue to negatively impact the health of many Americans. As a result, preventable diseases remain a leading cause of death as many individuals are unable to access the care they need.

In contrast, Thailand, an upper-middle-income nation dedicates only 5.2% of its GDP to healthcare, which costs roughly $364 per person. Despite operating with a smaller budget, Thailand has made progress in managing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and improving overall health outcomes. A key factor in this success is the introduction of universal health coverage in 2002. This change significantly reduced healthcare disparities and shielded citizens from crippling medical expenses. Additionally, the country's focus on primary care, education, and preventive health measures has allowed Thailand to mitigate death rates from NCDs as effectively as the U.S.

This comparison reveals a paradox: while the U.S. invests heavily in healthcare, its fragmented and for-profit system prevent it from achieving optimal health outcomes. On the other hand, Thailandâ€™s focus on healthcare accessibility has yielded impressive results despite its modest resources. This comparison demonstrates that an effective healthcare system does not solely depend on financial investment but also on policy design and equitable access.
