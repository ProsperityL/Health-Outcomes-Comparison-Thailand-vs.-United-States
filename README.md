# Health-Outcomes-Comparison-Thailand-vs.-United-States

Although the United States spends significantly more on healthcare, it lags behind other countries in terms of health outcomes. In 2021, the U.S. dedicated 18.3% of its GDP to healthcare, amounting to approximately $12,914 per person. Despite this considerable investment, issues such as high costs, restricted access to care, and delayed intervention often hinder the healthcare system's effectiveness, contributing to poorer outcomes. Leading causes of death in the U.S., such as noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), remain prevalent due to the lack of preventive care and the high cost of healthcare services.

In contrast, Thailand, an upper-middle-income country, spends far less on healthcare—just 5.2% of its GDP, which equates to $364 per person. Despite this much lower expenditure, Thailand has made remarkable progress in managing NCDs and other health conditions. The introduction of universal health coverage in 2002 has been a pivotal factor in this success, reducing health inequalities and safeguarding citizens from the financial burdens of healthcare costs. Furthermore, the country’s emphasis on primary care, education, and preventive healthcare has enabled Thailand to mitigate chronic diseases at a level comparable to the U.S., all while spending significantly less.

This comparison highlights an important paradox: while the U.S. pours vast resources into its healthcare system, the lack of accessible and timely care contributes to underwhelming health outcomes. On the other hand, Thailand, with far fewer resources, has developed strategic policies and improved healthcare access to achieve similar, if not better, results. This demonstrates that effective healthcare delivery hinges not just on financial investment but also on equitable access, preventive measures, and well-implemented policy frameworks.
